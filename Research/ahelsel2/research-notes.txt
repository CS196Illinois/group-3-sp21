=====================================
GETTING STARTED:
=====================================
Unity Layout:
	4 Main Portions of the Unity Program:
		- Scene Window
			You're able to view what you're working on (in the world) and move things around. Basically a 3D space
			where you can move objects around. A 'scene' is basically the world the game is contained within.
		- Hierarchy Window
			All of the objects in a scene(in the window above) will be listed here. You can group objects together
			depending on if they correlate with one another. This way, if you do one thing to a Object with a higher
			heirarchy, the objects below it in heirarchy will also be affected. And you can have things in different
			groups so that you can change on object without affecting other objects in the current scene.
		- Inspector Window
			Settings will be here that pertain to the object you currently have selected. So; you select a Scene,
			then select a group of objects, then select and object, and the Object's properties will be listed
			in the 'Inspector' window.
		- Project Window
			Contains things called 'assets'. Assets the different properties a game (or any project) has. So, any	
			music, models, pictures, or anything that could possibly be in your game, will be contained in the 
			'Project' Window. You use this to switch between given assets. Once you choose an asset you can use it
			within the scene with your other objects in the other windows.
	
	The 'Toolbar':
		Use the toolbar to test the game itself. After you implement something or change something, you use the
		toolbar to test everything within the scene. 
			Play, Pause, and Step: 
				Play is used to start a given scene/game, Pause stops it. Step can be used to increment slowly
				through a scene rather than going full speed through it as you would with 'Play'.
			Object Manipulation:
				Hand, Rotate, and Move:
					Hand is used to change your view/perspective within the scene. You don't actually move any
					object with 'Hand', you just move your viewpoint. 'Move' lets you move objects around in the 
					scene. 'Rotate' lets you choose a Object and rotate it on an axis. 'Scale' allows you to make
					something bigger or smaller.

					
====================================
Actually Creating the Game:
====================================
	World:
		First, create a new 'Scene'. There are RPG templates to choose from. Templates contain Objects/Collections
		of objects in order to help you get started.
			There are 4 Aspects to an RPG World (atleast with this tutorial)
				Background:
					The background, things you can see but cannot touch/go to.
				Midground:
					Things inside the world that you can see but are more decorative than functional and may be out of reach
				Foreground:
					Things you can see/be directly next to and probably serve a more functional purpose. 
				Fences:
					Say where a player can and can't go within a world. (Basically sets the bounds)
			The 'Tilemap':
				The tilemap is the way in which the world is laid out in this format of RPG. The world is divided into blocks
				or 'tiles' that you can individually apply textures and effects to.  
		'Palettes':
			Palettes are premade textures and effects to help you make the world.
				Palettes can be applied using different tools:	
					Paintbrush: Select a tile and change it's color
					Fillbox: Drag the cursor to select bounds in which to apply a texture/effect
					Picker: Pick tiles to apply a texture to
					Eraser: Used to erase a texture/effect applied to a certain tile
			
			Effects:
				Effects can help make your world seem bigger than it is and also make it easier to navigate. For example
				the 'Fade' effect can be used when entering a building by removing the roof so you can see into the	
				building from above.
					In order to add an effect to an Object:
						Add a component called 'Box Collider' in the Inspector Window. 
						Add a 'trigger' where to effect will be triggered
							For example, the door/entrance of a building would be a trigger so that when you	
							enter the building the 'Fade' effect would trigger and the roof would fade away
							

	Content:
		NPCs:
			NPCs are characters within the game that are not the player but that the player can interact with
			in an RPG
				Conversations:
					'Conversation Script' component is found in the 'Inspector' Window and can be used to add diologue as
					well as diologue branches.
						A diologue branch is basically how the diologue progresse. So, based on the diologue option the 
						player chooses, a response will be given. You can have different responses and diologue 'paths'
						for different responses chosen by the player
					Under the 'Conversation Script' in Inspector, there is a menu for branches.
						Branches are labelled 1.0 , 1.1, 1.2, etc; with 1.0 being the original diologue and everything
						after being a branch. So with a certain response chosen by the player, you can choose to output
						'1.1' or '1.2' or whichever branch you want.
