CLICK ON "RAW" TO VIEW WITH ORIGINAL FORMATTING AND BULLET POINTS

-> Getting Started
    -> When installing Unity, make sure to also download the Android Build Support module
    -> Unity has a Mobile 3D Game template that we can use when starting a project
    -> Once the project has loaded, to link an Android device, go to File → Build Settings and select Android
    -> Also, go to Edit → Editor and change the Device from “None” to “Any Android Device”
    -> Now, FOR NON-ANDROID USERS (idk if this is the best way)
        -> To run the project on an emulator, open up Android Studio and Create a New Project
        -> Once the project is made, click the AVD Manager in the top right corner and create a new virtual device
        -> Once you launch the emulator, go back to Unity and now you should be able to run the project on the emulator
            -> For some emulators, I got an error “Your device does not match the hardware requirements of this application”
                -> Go to Edit → Project Settings → Player and change Color Space to “Gamma” and check the box “Auto Graphics API”
            -> File → Build and Run
        -> To make sure the game can only be played in Landscape mode, go to Edit → Project Settings → Player → Resolution and Presentation, change Default Orientation to “Auto Rotation” and unclick “Portrait” and “Portrait Upside Down”

-> Basic Controls in Unity
    -> Scroll to zoom in and out
    -> Click on the hand icon in the top left corner to move the view around
    -> Right click to adjust the angle of the view
    -> To move objects, click on the 4 arrows icon and now you can click and drag any objects to be moved
    -> Click on the three axes on an object to move in the specified directions 

-> Building a Player
    -> Right click on the Hierarchy side and create a 3D Cube
        -> Rename this to GFX as this will function as our graphics (I think)
        -> Under Inspector, remove the Box Collider component
    -> Then right click again and create a Empty Object
        -> Rename this to Player as this will function as out player
    -> Drag GFX to be into/under the Player
        -> In the Inspector for Player, add the component NavMeshAgent
            -> This handles the Player’s pathfinding and spatial reasoning
            -> We can edit the values as needed
    -> We can add a Capsule Collider component to control Player collisions
    -> We can also add a RigidBody component to put the Player under the effects of physics in Unity
        -> Check the “isKinematic” box
    -> To actually control the Player, we can add a component “New Script” which we can use an IDE like Visual Studios to edit the code
        -> Scripts in Unity are coded in C# which is something I never have worked on before
        -> Still not sure how to integrate Java code
    -> Helpful Video for making a First Person Player

-> Building a Level Map (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtzIXCKr8Wo&ab_channel=Brackeys)
    -> We can Install the packages ProBuilder and ProGrid to help with design
        -> Go to Window → Package Manager and search ProBuilder
        -> For ProGrids, you may need to go to Advanced and select “Show preview packages”
    -> To open up ProBuilder, go to Tools and then Alt-Click on a Cube
        -> We can adjust the dimensions from here
    -> Recommendation: 
        -> Create a Material in the Assets folder in the Project window and set the main map to be GridBox_Default 	
            -> You may need to click the eye icon in the top right hand corner to unhide certain textures
        -> Then, to set this texture for everything, go to Edit → Preferences → ProBuilder, scroll down to Material and drag and drop the Material we just created in there
    -> We can use ProBuilder to make floors, walls, stairs, objects, etc
    -> Helpful tips
        -> Control + D duplicates an object
        -> Select a face and hold shift when “moving” an object to extend it
        -> We can also place the First Person Player from above into our level to move around and play the game
    -> From here, just follow the rest of the steps in the video
        -> We can use this to design the different rooms for our game
