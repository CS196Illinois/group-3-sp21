This is a summary of all the sprint meetings.

Sprint 1 -\
This week try to watch some unity tutorials (there's plenty of rpg specific ones like the one emily sent). Check out unity learn for some additional tutorial help. Check out the repo's research folder and store your notes in the folder with your netid so the notes are all stored in one place for easy reference. You can change the md file to a txt or anything else if you find it more convenient. Then we'll have another brief meeting sometime before the Sprint 1 deadline (Thursday 03/11) to discuss some of the things you guys found interesting/helpful, etc.


Sprint 2 -\
Mid-point meeting - we reviewed the 3 tasks we were working on and have completed android integration along with character movement and first person camera controls, and have imported a few assets including map design and textures.

End meeting - we determined our Android integration is almost ready (we need to fix a few bugs with the camera), we have some textures saved in labeled folders for easy access later, we have a decent start to our 3d map (need to integrate seperate rooms).


Sprint 3 -\
This was mostly just importing character models, creating a menu, and implementing some added animations for the npc models.


Sprint 4 -\
We added buttons to the screen for attacking and jumping, implemented some more animations for the main character, and put together our scipts in the group repo.


Sprint 5 -\
Finishing up our project, putting together the pieces, and getting ready to put together a demo for the final presentation.
